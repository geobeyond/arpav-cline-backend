# Palettes

This directory contains a copy of the palette files used by ncWMS. These were obtained by copying them from
the edal-java source code repository, available at:

https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/edal-java

In the edal-java repo, these palette files are found under:

`graphics/src/main/resources/palettes`
